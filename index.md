Change layout to about from al-folio. Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite subreddit. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture prof_pic.jpg and put it in the assets/images/ folder.

This has to be the home page and must include a photo and contact information. The photo must be aligned based on the option specified in the YAML of the about page.
